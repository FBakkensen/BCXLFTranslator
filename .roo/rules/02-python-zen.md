# Python Zen Principles

1. **Code Clarity and Aesthetics**:
   - Beautiful is better than ugly
   - Readability counts
   - Explicit is better than implicit

2. **Code Simplicity**:
   - Simple is better than complex
   - Complex is better than complicated
   - Flat is better than nested
   - Sparse is better than dense

3. **Code Design**:
   - There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it
   - Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules
   - Although practicality beats purity
   - Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors should never pass silently
   - Unless explicitly silenced
   - In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess

5. **Implementation Timing**:
   - Now is better than never
   - Although never is often better than right now
   - If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea
   - If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea
