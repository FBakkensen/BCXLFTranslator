# Implementation Guidelines

1. **Code Development**:
   - Never implement hardcoded solutions that directly return expected test values
   - Develop proper algorithms that work for all cases, not just test cases
   - Implement the simplest solution that works for the general case
   - Function implementation should be independent of test data

2. **Verification**:
   - Always run the full test suite before committing changes
   - Ensure all tests pass before considering work complete
   - Review test coverage for new code
   - Document any test-specific setup or requirements

Remember: Red -> Green -> Refactor, and never implement features without tests or with hardcoded solutions!
