# XLIFF Format Preservation Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the steps needed to ensure XLIFF files maintain the exact header and footer from input files while only updating the trans-units during translation.

## Tasks

1. [x] **Create a function to extract header and footer from input file**
   - **Prompt**: "Implement a function called `extract_header_footer` that reads an XLIFF file as text and extracts the exact header (everything before the first trans-unit) and footer (everything after the last trans-unit). Use `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf` as a reference file."
   - **Verification**: The function correctly extracts the header and footer from test XLIFF files with different structures, particularly `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`. Verify by printing the extracted parts and confirming they match the expected content. Run all tests to ensure functionality works correctly.

2. [x] **Create a function to extract trans-units for processing**
   - **Prompt**: "Implement a function called `extract_trans_units` that parses an XLIFF file and returns a list of all trans-unit elements as XML Element objects for processing. Test with `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`."
   - **Verification**: The function correctly extracts all trans-units from test XLIFF files, including `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`. Verify by counting the number of extracted units and comparing with the expected count. Run all tests to ensure functionality works correctly.

3. [x] **Create a function to convert processed trans-units back to text**
   - **Prompt**: "Implement a function called `trans_units_to_text` that converts a list of processed trans-unit XML Element objects back to properly formatted text, preserving all attributes and maintaining consistent indentation. Use the format in `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf` as a reference."
   - **Verification**: The function correctly converts trans-units to text with proper formatting. Compare the output with the original formatting in `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`. Run all tests to ensure functionality works correctly.

4. [x] **Modify the main translation function to use the new approach**
   - **Prompt**: "Update the `translate_xliff` function to use the new header/footer preservation approach. It should extract the header and footer, process only the trans-units, and then combine them back together to create the output file. Test with `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`."
   - **Verification**: The function successfully translates `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf` while preserving the exact header and footer. Compare the input and output files to confirm only the trans-units were modified. Run all tests to ensure functionality works correctly.

5. [x] **Add indentation preservation for trans-units**
   - **Prompt**: "Implement a function called `preserve_indentation` that extracts the indentation pattern from the original trans-units and applies it to the processed trans-units to maintain consistent formatting. Use `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf` to verify correct indentation preservation."
   - **Verification**: The processed trans-units in the output file have the same indentation pattern as in `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`. Visually compare the indentation in both files. Run all tests to ensure functionality works correctly.

6. [x] **Handle XML namespaces in trans-units**
   - **Prompt**: "Enhance the trans-unit processing to properly handle XML namespaces, ensuring that namespace prefixes and declarations are preserved in the output file. Test with `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf` which contains namespace declarations."
   - **Verification**: The output file correctly preserves all namespace prefixes and declarations from `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`. Check that elements with namespaces in the input file maintain those namespaces in the output. Run all tests to ensure functionality works correctly.

7. [x] **Add error handling for malformed XLIFF files**
   - **Prompt**: "Add robust error handling to the header/footer extraction process to gracefully handle malformed XLIFF files or files without trans-units. Create test cases based on modifications to `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`."
   - **Verification**: The code handles various edge cases (empty files, files without trans-units, malformed XML) without crashing and provides helpful error messages. Run all tests to ensure functionality works correctly.

8. [x] **Create a validation function for output files**
   - **Prompt**: "Implement a function called `validate_xliff_format` that verifies the output file maintains the exact header and footer from the input file while correctly updating the trans-units. Test with `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf` and its translated output."
   - **Verification**: The validation function correctly identifies whether an output file preserves the header and footer from `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`. Run all tests to ensure functionality works correctly.

9. [x] **Add unit tests for the new functions**
   - **Prompt**: "Create comprehensive unit tests for all the new functions related to header/footer preservation, covering various XLIFF file structures and edge cases. Include specific tests using `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`."
   - **Verification**: All tests pass and achieve good code coverage for the new functionality. Run all tests to ensure functionality works correctly.

10. [x] **Update documentation to reflect the new approach**
    - **Prompt**: "Update the project documentation to explain the new header/footer preservation approach and its benefits for maintaining exact XLIFF formatting. Include `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf` as an example in the documentation."
    - **Verification**: The documentation clearly explains the new approach and provides examples of how it preserves the exact format using `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`. Run all tests to ensure functionality works correctly.

11. [x] **Create an integration test with real-world XLIFF files**
    - **Prompt**: "Create an integration test that uses real-world XLIFF files, including `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`, to verify the entire translation process preserves the exact header and footer while correctly translating the content."
    - **Verification**: The integration test passes with various real-world XLIFF files, including `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`, and the output files maintain the exact header and footer structure. Run all tests to ensure functionality works correctly.

12. [x] **Optimize performance for large XLIFF files**
    - **Prompt**: "Optimize the header/footer extraction and trans-unit processing for performance with large XLIFF files, ensuring efficient memory usage and processing time. Benchmark with `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf` and larger variants."
    - **Verification**: The optimized code successfully processes `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf` and larger XLIFF files (>1MB) with acceptable performance. Run all tests to ensure functionality works correctly.
