# Updated Terminology System MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the terminology-aware translation system using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

## MVP Scope
The MVP includes:
1. Phase 1: Core Terminology Management (Iterations 1-5)
2. Iteration 11: Streaming XLF Parser (from Phase 3)
3. Iterations 16-17: Terminology-Aware Translator Class and Integration with Main Translation Flow (from Phase 4)

## Detailed Plan

### Phase 1: Core Terminology Management (Iterations 1-5)
1. **Iteration 1: Basic Terminology Manager Class**
   - Create `TerminologyManager` class
   - Tests for class initialization

2. **Iteration 2: Adding and Retrieving Simple Terms**
   - Implement `add_term()` and `get_translation()` methods
   - Tests for these methods

3. **Iteration 3: Multi-Language Support**
   - Extend data structure for multiple language pairs
   - Update `get_translation()` for language-specific lookups
   - Tests for multi-language support

4. **Iteration 4: Basic XLF File Loading**
   - Implement `load_from_xlf()` method
   - Tests for loading terms from XLF files

5. **Iteration 5: Term Normalization**
   - Implement term normalization functions
   - Apply normalization in `add_term()` and `get_translation()`
   - Tests for term normalization

### Additional Iterations for MVP
6. **Iteration 11: Streaming XLF Parser**
   - Implement `StreamingXLFParser` class
   - Integrate streaming processing into `load_from_xlf()`
   - Tests for handling large XLF files

7. **Iteration 16: Terminology-Aware Translator Class**
   - Create `TerminologyAwareTranslator` class
   - Implement terminology-aware translation method
   - Tests for terminology-aware translation

8. **Iteration 17: Integration with Main Translation Flow**
   - Modify `translate_xliff()` to use terminology
   - Add terminology checks before machine translation
   - Tests for end-to-end terminology-aware translation

## Implementation Approach
- Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Incremental development with continuous testing
- Ensure each feature has tests before implementation

## Next Steps
1. Start implementing Iteration 1
2. Proceed through each iteration in order
3. Review and adjust the plan after completing Phase 1 if necessary
