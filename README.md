# BCXLFTranslator

A Python CLI tool for automating translations of XLIFF files (XML Localization Interchange File Format) using Google Translate. Primarily designed for software localization processes, especially for Business Central applications. Optimized for Windows environments.

## Features

- Automatic translation of XLIFF files using Google Translate
- Preserves XML formatting and namespaces
- Intelligent case matching to maintain proper capitalization
- Translation caching to ensure consistency and reduce API calls
- Handles specialized formatting like dotted words (e.g., "Prod.Order")
- Retry mechanism for handling transient errors
- Detailed progress reporting during translation
- Support for namespace-specific XML attributes
- **Translation source attribution**
- **Statistics reporting**
- **Exact XLIFF format preservation**:
  - Preserves the exact header and footer from input files
  - Maintains all file attributes (source-language, target-language, original)
  - Preserves XML indentation patterns and formatting

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Windows OS (primary target platform)

### Install from source (Windows)

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BCXLFTranslator.git
cd BCXLFTranslator

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .

# Or install with all dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Install required dependencies

```powershell
# In PowerShell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Setup on Windows

For convenience on Windows systems, you can use the included batch file to set up the environment:

```powershell
# From PowerShell, execute the activation script
.\activate_venv.bat
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
# Using the module directly (recommended for src layout)
python -m src.bcxlftranslator.main input.xlf output.xlf
```

### Command-Line Arguments

- `input.xlf`: Path to the source XLIFF file to be translated
- `output.xlf`: Path where the translated XLIFF file should be saved
- `--help`: Show help information

### Example Workflow

1. Export XLIFF translation file from Business Central
2. Run BCXLFTranslator on the file
3. Import the translated file back into Business Central

```powershell
# Example with specific files in PowerShell
python -m src.bcxlftranslator.main "./BaseApp.en-US.xlf" "./BaseApp.fr-FR.xlf"

# With full paths (Windows style)
python -m src.bcxlftranslator.main "C:\Projects\BC\BaseApp.en-US.xlf" "C:\Projects\BC\BaseApp.fr-FR.xlf"
```

### Translation Source Attribution

The output XLIFF includes source attribution notes:

```xml
<trans-unit id="example-id">
  <source>Custom Field</source>
  <target>Brugerdefineret felt</target>
  <note from="BCXLFTranslator">Source: Google Translate</note>
</trans-unit>
```

### Translation Statistics

After translation, BCXLFTranslator provides statistics about the translation process:

```
Translation statistics:
---------------------
Total translations: 534
Google Translate used: 534 (100.0%)
```

## How It Works

BCXLFTranslator processes XLIFF files by:

1. Extracting the exact header and footer from the input file
2. Preserving indentation patterns and formatting from the original file
3. Parsing the XML structure while preserving namespaces
4. Identifying source and target languages from file metadata
5. Finding translation units that need translation
6. Translating text using Google Translate with intelligent caching
7. Applying case matching to maintain capitalization patterns
8. Preserving XML attributes and structure
9. Adding source attribution notes
10. Recombining the translated trans-units with the original header and footer
11. Writing the translated content back to the output file while maintaining exact formatting
12. Generating translation statistics

## Advanced Features

### Case Matching

The translator intelligently matches the capitalization pattern of the source text:
- ALL CAPS text stays in ALL CAPS
- Title Case text stays in Title Case
- Preserves special formatting like "Prod.Order" with proper capitalization

### Translation Caching

Identical source texts are cached to:
- Ensure consistency across the document
- Reduce the number of API calls
- Improve translation speed for repeated terms

### XLIFF Format Preservation

The tool precisely preserves the original XLIFF file structure:
- Maintains the exact header and footer from the input file
- Preserves all file attributes (source-language, target-language, original)
- Retains XML namespaces and declarations
- Maintains consistent indentation patterns for all elements
- Only modifies the content of trans-units that need translation
- Preserves all XML attributes on trans-unit elements

Example of preserved formatting from `examples\Example.da-dk.xlf`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xliff version="1.2" xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xliff:document:1.2" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="urn:oasis:names:tc:xliff:document:1.2 xliff-core-1.2-transitional.xsd">
  <file datatype="xml" source-language="en-US" target-language="da-dk" original="Document Automation">
    <body>
      <group id="body">
        <trans-unit id="Table 4110714008 - Field 4106504947 - Property 2879900210" size-unit="char" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Attached To SystemID</source>
          <target>Vedh√¶ftet til SystemID</target>
          <note from="Developer" annotates="general" priority="2"/>
          <note from="Xliff Generator" annotates="general" priority="3">Table Attached File - Field Attached To SystemID - Property Caption</note>
          <note from="BCXLFTranslator">Source: Google Translate</note>
        </trans-unit>
        <!-- Additional trans-units -->
      </group>
    </body>
  </file>
</xliff>
```

### Error Handling

The tool includes:
- Retry mechanisms for transient network errors
- Detailed logging of translation progress and errors
- Summary statistics after completion
- Robust error handling for malformed XLIFF files

## Configuration

The following configuration parameters can be adjusted in the code:

- `DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS`: Time delay between translation requests (default: 0.5s)
- `MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum number of retries for failed translations (default: 3)
- `RETRY_DELAY`: Time to wait before retrying (default: 3.0s)

## Known Limitations

- Uses the unofficial `googletrans` library which may be subject to rate limiting
- Translation quality depends on Google Translate's capabilities for the language pair

## Development

### Setting Up a Development Environment (Windows)

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BCXLFTranslator.git
cd BCXLFTranslator

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment (Windows PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# If using standard Command Prompt
# .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Windows-Specific Notes

- File paths in Windows use backslashes (`\`) but these are escape characters in PowerShell strings. Either use:
  - Forward slashes (`/`) which work in Python on Windows
  - Double backslashes (`\\`)
  - PowerShell's `-LiteralPath` parameter style where applicable

- If you encounter permission issues in PowerShell, you may need to adjust execution policy:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

### Running Tests

```powershell
# In PowerShell
python -m pytest -v
```

### Test Coverage

```powershell
pytest --cov=bcxlftranslator
